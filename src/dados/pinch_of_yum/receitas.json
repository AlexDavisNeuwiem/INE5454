        "INSTRUCTIONS": [
            "Preheat:Preheat the oven to 450 degrees andplace a rack at the highest position, near the top.",
            "Prep Cottage Cheese:Blend the cottage cheese until smooth.",
            "Make Dough for Crust:Place blended cottage cheese in a bowl; mix with the flour, baking powder and salt until a dough starts to come together. It will start to get kind of shaggy, crumbly, and sticky – use your hands to really bring it together. I usually turn it out on the counter and give it a few squishes, coating with a bit of extra flour, to make it into a cohesive ball.",
            "Form The Crust:Place a sheet of parchment on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Place the dough on the parchment and press into a circle that is about 10-12 inches in diameter. It is a pretty bready crust, so you want to really press it out into a thinner, wider surface area.",
            "Prep The Crust:Rub the top of the crust with olive oil.",
            "Pre-Bake The Crust:Place in the oven; bake (no toppings) for 8-10 minutes.",
            "Add Sauce and Cheese:Remove from oven. Spread with sauce and top with the two cheeses. Bake on that same top rack for another 5 minutes to melt the cheeses.",
            "Broil and Finish:Finally, broil for 2-3 minutes until the cheese and crust edges are deeply golden, like the picture. I like to sprinkle the slices with red pepper flakes, drizzle with olive oil or hot honey, and dip into more sauce! It’s too good!"

            "Thaw the Berries:Microwave 2 cups frozen berries for one minute. Transfer thawed berries to a fine mesh strainer; gently rinse the berries with warm water for 15-30 seconds to wash off the excess colored juices. I like to tap the side of the strainer to get even more water out. The berries will reduce in volume and you’ll be left with about 1 cup of thawed berries.",
            "Add Berries to Muffin Batter:Gently fold the berries into the muffin batter. (There shouldn’t be much excess juice going into the bowl with the thawed berries.) Give it just a few stirs so you incorporate the berries – they’ll get a little mashed, but you want to keep about half of the berries intact.",
            "Top with Sugar:Grease a muffin tin with butter or nonstick baking spray (I prefer this over paper liners). Divide the batter between 9-10 muffin cups, and top with a spoonful of turbinado sugar.",
            "Bake:Bake the muffins for 14-16 minutes, in the middle to top of the oven. Remove from oven and let cool slightly before using a knife to gently release and pull each one out of the muffin tin.",
            "You’re Done! Yum!If you want to serve these with honey butter, which I think you do – just stir the softened butter with the honey until incorporated. Spread it on a warm muffin and live your best life!"
