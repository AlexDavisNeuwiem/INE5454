If you do not have a sifter, use a spoon to spoon the flour into the 1 cup measure.\n Try it once the \"correct\" way and you will see an amazing difference in the end product.\nI have had many email from you kind folks about using non-alcoholic beverages instead of beer.\n That is fine to do but I highly recommend adding a packet of Dry Active Yeast or 2 teaspoons of Bread (Machine) Yeast so that you get a proper rise.\nThe final result should be a thick, hearty and very tasteful bread, NOT A BRICK! ;).\nThank you all for the incredibly nice comments and those of you who left a bad review - learn to sift sift SIFT!
