It is wise to HAVE some fat added to the deer -- especially to ground deer. Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult an expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman."

If you prefer a softer crust (like a traditional bread) mix the butter into the batter instead of pouring it over the top.Sifting flour for bread recipes is a must-do. Most people just scoop the 1 cup measure in the flour canister and level it off. That compacts the flour and will turn your bread into a \"hard biscuit\" as some have described. That's because they aren't sifting their flour! If you do not have a sifter, use a spoon to spoon the flour into the 1 cup measure. Try it once the \"correct\" way and you will see an amazing difference in the end product.I have had many email from you kind folks about using non-alcoholic beverages instead of beer. That is fine to do but I highly recommend adding a packet of Dry Active Yeast or 2 teaspoons of Bread (Machine) Yeast so that you get a proper rise.The final result should be a thick, hearty and very tasteful bread, NOT A BRICK! ;).Thank you all for the incredibly nice comments and those of you who left a bad review - learn to sift sift SIFT!

            "Preheat your oven to 450°F.Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, or in the bowl of a food processor.Cut the butter into chunks and cut into the flour until it resembles course meal.If using a food processor, just pulse a few times until this consistency is achieved.Add the buttermilk and mix JUST until combined.If it appears on the dry side, add a bit more buttermilk. It should be very wet.Turn the dough out onto a floured board.Gently, gently PAT (do NOT roll with a rolling pin) the dough out until it's about 1/2\" thick. Fold the dough about 5 times, gently press the dough down to a 1 inch thick.Use a round cutter to cut into rounds.You can gently knead the scraps together and make a few more, but they will not be anywhere near as good as the first ones.Place the biscuits on a cookie sheet- if you like soft sides, put them touching each other.If you like\"crusty\" sides, put them about 1 inch apart- these will not rise as high as the biscuits put close together.Bake for about 10-12 minutes- the biscuits will be a beautiful light golden brown on top and bottom.Do not overbake.Note: The key to real biscuits is not in the ingredients, but in the handling of the dough.The dough must be handled as little as possible or you will have tough biscuits.I have found that a food processor produces superior biscuits, because the ingredients stay colder and there's less chance of overmixing.You also must pat the dough out with your hands, lightly.Rolling with a rolling pin is a guaranteed way to overstimulate the gluten, resulting in a tougher biscuit.Note 2: You can make these biscuits, cut them, put them on cookie sheets and freeze them for up to a month.When you want fresh biscuits, simply place them frozen on the cookie sheet and bake at 450°F for about 20 minutes."

They all come out good, but the Betty Crocker does come out the best.I was having a problem with my cookies flattening while baking.  This usually happens with the generic cake mix brands.  You can play with your oven temp and try them on 375 to keep them from spreading.  Adding more oil than called for will also cause the cookies to spread -- I wouldn't suggest it, they really don't need extra oil.Another way to keep them nice and thick and to get the most \"crinkled\" or \"crackled\" look is to make them bigger.  When I roll them at about 1.5 inches they look prettier.And my best tip:  My confectioners' sugar was consistently being absorbed by the dough.  The last time I baked them, I rolled them into balls without rolling in the sugar and let them \"dry\" for a few minutes.  Then I rolled them in sugar and baked.  These came out with a nice coating of sugar that didn't disappear."

Transfer mixture to measuring cup and reserve exactly 2 cups. Discard excess.Remove ribs and seeds from 2 jalapenos and discard. Mince flesh and set aside. Mince remaining jalapeno. Set aside.Place rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear- about 1 1/2 minutes.Shake rice vigorously to remove excess water.This step removes the starch from the rice so it will not stick. IF YOU OMIT THIS STEP YOUR RICE WILL NOT BE DRY AND FLUFFY.Heat oil in heavy bottomed ovensafe 12 inch straight sided sautee pan or Dutch oven with tight fitting lid over low-medium heat about 2 minutes. (The recipe is very specific about this but I used a 10 inch dutch oven and it worked out fine.) Drop a few rice grains in and if they sizzle then it is ready. Add rice and fry stirring until rice is light golden and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.  Be careful that the oil doesn't get too hot too fast or the oil will splatter.Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and 2 minced jalapenos and cook , stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes.Stir in broth, pureed mixture,tomato paste, and salt. Increase heat to medium high, and bring to a boil.Cover pan and transfer pan to oven to bake until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 30-35 minutes.Stir well after 15 minutes.Stir in cilantro, minced jalapeno to taste, and pass lime wedges separately.Edited to add 6-15-05: If you can't get good fresh tomatoes you are better off using canned tomatoes. Don't use those awful hard and underipe tomatoes that are at most supermarket chains. Just be sure that the processed tomatoes and the one onion equals 2 cups. One the other hand- if you find that after processing your tomatoes and onions that you have less than 2 cups- simply add enough bottled salsa to make up the difference.Edited 8-21-06: Do not skip any of the steps. It may seem stupid- but rinsing the rice to remove the starch is very important if you want fluffy rice. It will only take two minutes of your time but it makes the difference.Edited 8-15-08: Leftovers are just as delicious the next day so this is a perfect dish to make ahead time for potlucks. This rice also freezes well. For Freezing Ahead: Cool, portion and freeze in a ziploc bag. To reheat from frozen: Place in a pyrex dish and warm in the microwave, stirring every 2-3 minutes until heated through.You'll love this rice! Money back guarantee."

        "INGREDIENTS": [
            "2 cups    sugar",
            "1 3⁄4 cups    flour",
            "3⁄4 cup    baking cocoa (dutch process or dark cocoa preferably)",

            "3⁄4 - 1 cup    boiling water (see note below)"
        ],
        "INSTRUCTIONS": [
            "Heat oven to 350°F.Grease and flour two 9 inch round baking pans or one 13x9 inch pan.In large mixer bowl, stir together dry ingredients.Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes.Stir in boiling water by hand (batter will be thin). NOTE: I have tried it with 1/2 cup, 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup boiling water and we prefer it with less than 1 cup water. I usually use between 2/3 & 3/4 cups. The cake is still very moist but it doesn't seem to \"fall\" as much as it cools. This might have to do with our high humidity or brand of flour or other factors so I don't know if it will work for everyone.Pour into prepared pan.Bake 30 to 35 minutes for round 9-inch pans, 35 to 40 minutes for rectangular pan or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. (Do not use 8-inch pans or the batter will overflow.).Because they have a tendency to overflow if you fill them more than 2/3 full, I usually get about 27-28 cupcakes per batch. Bake for approximately 18-20 minutes.Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan to wire racks.Please note: baking cocoa isn't hot chocolate drink mix! Baking cocoa contains no sugar and it is found on the baking aisle. Chocolate drink mixes that you add to milk or water to drink WILL NOT work in this recipe."
