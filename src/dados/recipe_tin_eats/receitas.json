            "Preheat the oven to 220°C/450°F (200°C fan). Arrange the oven racks so they are 20 cm/8\" apart (for air circulation)., Spicy maple sauce – Mix until combined. Set aside., Sweet potato – Cut each sweet potato lengthways into 6 wedges (or 8, if they are thicker potatoes). Put on a paper lined tray, then toss with the maple syrup, olive oil, salt and pepper. Lay sweet potato wedges on their side., Chickpeas – Drain the chickpeas then spread on a tray (still wet)., Baking – Put both trays in the oven (sweet potato on the top shelf). Roast the potatoes for 30 minutes, turning them at the halfway mark. Take the chickpeas out after 10 minutes to flavour them., Crispy seasoned chickpeas – Remove the oven dried chickpeas from the oven after 10 minutes (Note 4). Push them to one side of the tray, drizzle/sprinkle and toss with the oil, spices, salt and pepper. Toss well using a rubber spatula, then return to the oven for a further 15 – 20 minutes until they're crispy (they will clatter! Note 4)., Sweet potato charring (optional) – After 30 minutes (or when the potatoes are soft), switch the oven grill/broiler to high. Tuck in or fold down excess paper around the tray edges (so it doesn't touch heat element and catch fire). Stand the wedges sharp edge facing up, then pop it under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes until a bit charred on the edges. ⚠️ SAFETY NOTE: Do not walk away, make sure the paper does not catch fire., Whipped tahini yogurt sauce – While the potatoes are roasting whisk ingredients in a heat-proof bowl just to combine. When ready to use, microwave for just 30 seconds on high, then whisk again for 10 seconds – it will resemble softly whipped cream. (Note 5), Optional tahini drizzle – Remove 1/4 cup of the tahini sauce and loosen with a little water to a drizzle-able consistency., Assemble – Spread the whipped tahini on a large plate. Pile the sweet potato on, mostly in a single layer. Drizzle with the tahini drizzle (if using), the spicy maple sauce, sprinkle with most of the pistachio and coriander. Sprinkle over chickpeas, then sprinkle with the remaining coriander and pistachios. EAT! (PS Great served warm or at room temperature)"

Stir in the basil., Serve – Transfer into a serving bowl or divide between bowls. Dollop the whipped ricotta on top then randomly smear (or let everyone do that themselves), it will get all melty.

Cook for 2 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature is 98°C/208°F or the meat can be fairly easily teased apart using two fork (check in a discreet spot)., Rest – Remove lamb and potato to a tray and loosely cover with foil while you make the gravy.",
            "Drippings – The roasting pan will have meat juices and fat. Tilt the pan so you can scoop off and discard all but 3 tablespoons of fat (the clear liquid that rises to the surface). Make sure you keep the dark brown juices in the pan. If you're short of fat, add butter., Heat fat – Put the pan directly on the stove over medium heat. Once the fat is hot, sprinkle the flour over and stir for 1 minute., Thicken – While stirring, slowly pour in the stock. Add soy sauce, then keep stirring as it bubbles gently until it thickens into a maple syrup consistency., Taste and add more salt and pepper if desired (I don't need more). Pour into a jug (strain, if needed).",

Lower heat a tiny bit if needed to stop the eggs from jostling around so much they crack., Boil and swirl –  Boil eggs for 10 minutes. Swirl the water every minute for the first 6 minutes, using the handle of a wooden spoon. Give the water 4 or 5 fast stirs in one direction to make the water and eggs swirl in the water. The centrifugal force will make the yolks cook centred in the egg white (ie no thin broken egg white walls) (Note 4)., Peel – Fill a sink with cold tap water. Remove eggs from the boiling water using a slotted spoon or spider. Leave for 5 minutes until cool enough to handle. Tap the base then peel under water (it's easier).",

Blitz until yolks are broken up. Add butter and blitz, scraping down the sides as needed, until the butter is blended through. The filling should be creamy (smear with back of spoon to check)., Choose the best 18 to 20 egg white halves. (Note 6) Brush yolk crumbs off the cut surface., Pipe – Transfer filling into a piping bag fitted with a nozzle of your choice (I use a star). Fill so it's mounded – I do about the same amount as a whole yolk., Sprinkle with paprika and chives. Serve! (Best enjoyed at room temperature rather than fridge cold as the filling is creamier.)"

Carefully lower chicken into the oil.

Using the same beater (no need to clean), beat on high for 1 minute just until it's soft and smooth. Add the vanilla, lemon and melted gelatine, then beat for 10 seconds on high to mix it through thoroughly. Don't beat excessively as we don't want too many air bubbles in the cheesecake (unsightly)., Fold – Add about 1/4 of the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Gently fold through using a rubber spatula or large spoon (don't mix aggressively, you'll knock all the air out of the cream!). Then fold in the rest of the cream., Refrigerate – Pour into the crust, smooth the surface. Refrigerate for 6 hours+ to set.",

            "Sauce – Mix the ingredients in a bowl and set aside to let the flavours meld while you make the kofta kebabs., Kofta kebabs – Put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well with your hands until the spices are mixed through. Divide into 8, shape into 13cm/5″ logs. Thread onto skewers then flatten slightly to about 1.25cm / 0.5″ thick (Note 5)., Cook – Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook half the koftas for 2 minutes on each side until golden, then about 30 seconds on each short edge (just for a bit of colour). Reduce the heat if they’re browning too fast. Transfer to a serving plate, loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Cook the remaining koftas. (Scrape out loose burnt bits, if any. You shouldn’t need extra oil.), Serve and assemble! Pile the lettuce, tomato and onion on the plate and put the sauce in a bowl. To assemble, take a warm pita bread and smear some sauce down the middle. Top with lettuce and 1 or 2 koftas (removed from the skewers), tuck tomato down the side and sprinkle with onion. Fold and EAT!"

(~1 hour), Chop the reserved pistachios (mix of finely chopped and larger chunks)., Spread the cake with the Cream Cheese Whip (steps below). Sprinkle with chopped pistachios. Cut and eat!",

Stickier dough = softer gnocchi! Use the remaining flour, 1 tbsp at a time, if needed, but try to stick with 3/4 cup. You can always add more flour in the next step. (Note 3), Form disc – Sprinkle a work surface with flour then scrape the dough out onto it. Sprinkle the top lightly with flour then use your hands to give the dough a light knead to bring it into a ball then pat it into a disc about 2.5cm/1\" thick. Cut it into 8 wedges, using a knife or dough scraper dusted with flour as needed between each cut, Roll and cut – Roll each piece into a log 25cm/10\" long, about 1.25cm / 1/2\" wide. Cut into 1.5 cm / 3/5\" pieces (Can freeze at this point – Note 4)",

Cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms is softened., Sauce – Add the wine and simmer rapidly for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring to scrape the base of the pan, until mostly evaporated. Add the stock/broth and cream, then stir., Simmer – Bring to a simmer then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer gently for 5 minutes until thickened. (It's ok if it seems a bit thin, the starch from gnocchi will thicken it quickly, have faith!).",
            "Cook gnocchi – Bring a large pot of water to the boil with 2 teaspoons of salt. Tumble the gnocchi in and cook for around 2 1/2 minutes, or until the gnocchi is floating on the surface for around 30 seconds, no longer (else they overcook!), Sauce it – Use a spider or large slotted spoon to scoop the gnocchi out of the water and straight into the sauce (excess water drips in the sauce are good!). Turn the heat up to medium and toss gently for 1 minute or until the sauce thickens and coats the gnocchi. If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash of the gnocchi cooking water., Serve immediately, garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley, if desired."

Add the stock, canned tomato, salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer., Simmer – Then carefully place the chicken into the sauce (skin side up) and pour any juices on the tray in as well. When the liquid returns to a simmer, cover, reduce the heat to medium then simmer energetically for 20 minutes. Remove lid, add olives, simmer for a further 10 minutes (no lid).

Then place the mussels in a single layer, or shingled (stacked but level). Spoon on a little of the diced vegetables and some reserved mussel cooking liquor., Sauce and lemon – Nestle bowls filled with sauces amongst the seafood and scatter over lemon wedges.

Goal: Thick glaze that will ooze \"pudding style\", as pictured, rather than dripping in long streaks. Spoon onto cake, coaxing it down the sides. Allow to set before wrapping., Fondant – See directions in my classic round Christmas Cake., Serving – serve with custard for a traditional experience! Either homemade custard or store bought pouring custard."

If necessary, enclose powdery bits in your fist to press them into clumps!, Bake for 65 minutes, rotating the pan halfway, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean (blueberry smear is ok!)., Cool 10 minutes in the pan. Remove the cake from the springform pan then cool for at least another 10 minutes before cutting to serve., Serving – For the best blueberry crumble-cake experience, serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Otherwise, be normal and serve it at room temperature. Ice cream or cream also welcome here."

Brush with a bit of pressure across the surface of the potatoes to encourage the oil and salt to drip down. Once oil gets between the slices, they will fan out more and more., CRISP IT! – Once the potatoes are soft in the centre (check with knife), turn the oven UP to 220°C/425°F (200°C). Baste the potatoes again then bake for a further 10 – 15 minutes until the edges are nice and golden.

Drizzle over 2 tablespoons of the marinade, then use fingers to mix through to form lumps – when this sticks to the chicken, it fries up into awesome crunchy bits!!, Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium high heat to 180°C/350°F (Note 2)., Coat chicken – Pick up a piece of chicken and allow excess marinade to drip off. Press to coat in flour coating. Shake off excess, then fry for 2 minutes on each side until golden. DO NOT TOUCH for the first 90 seconds to allow the coating to adhere. I fry 2 at a time. Drain on paper towels, cook remaining chicken., Assemble – Smear garlic mayo on the top and bottom of the buns. Pile lettuce on the base, top with tomato if using. Then chicken, gherkins and put the lid on. Sink your teeth into it immediately and enjoy!"

Turn the stove onto medium high heat – as it heats up, the fat will start to melt so the bacon cooks in its own fat. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until golden, then use a slotted spoon to transfer onto a paper towel lined plate. Reserve bacon fat in the pan., Cook corn – Top up with butter if you don’t have 1 tbsp fat left in pan. Still on medium high, add corn, then stir only every minute or so (this lets it get some nice golden spots), for about 5 minutes until corn is just cooked and is sweet. Add garlic, stir for another 30 seconds. Add sake, stir until evaporated (~15 seconds)., Melt miso butter – Turn off stove. Add miso butter, stir until melted. Add pepper, bacon and green onion, toss until coated with sauce. Serve!, Serve as a side dish. In a corn taco with a fried egg and avocado (OMG SO GOOD)."

            "Prep – Preheat oven to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan) with the shelf in the middle. Press scrunched paper into 20cm/8\" springform pan., Batter – Beat cream cheese 2 minutes on medium. Beat in sugar on low speed for 10 seconds. In separate bowl, hand whisk 1/4 cup cream with the flour (becomes like paste). Whisk in remaining cream and vanilla. While beating on low, slowly pour cream into cream cheese, then eggs (don't overbeat)., Bake – Pour into pan, bang pan on counter, pop bubbles with knife. Bake 45 min (up to 65 min possible, Note 8) until top deep golden. Cool 2 hrs on counter then 8 hrs+ in fridge uncovered. Ready for serving!",
            "Preheat oven to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan) with the shelf in the middle of the oven., Pan prep (Note 4) – Press 2 x 40cm/16\" sheets of scrunched up baking/parchment paper arranged in an \"X\" into a 20cm/8\" springform pan (6cm / 2.5\" tall), and fold down over the rim to hold in place. You'll need to scrunch/pleat to fit which creates the signature rustic sides! The batter will weigh it down so don't worry if it doesn't stay in., Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until smooth and lump-free. Add sugar and beat on low speed for 10 seconds., Flour & cream (Note 6) – Put about 1/4 of the cream and all the flour in a medium bowl. Hand whisk until lump free (it will be paste-like), then slowly pour in the remaining cream while whisking. Once flour is incorporated, whisk in vanilla. (PS not making whipped cream here! Should be pourable), Slowly pour the cream into the cream cheese bowl with the beater going on low. Beat just until combined. Then slowly pour the eggs in while the beater is still on low speed. As soon as the eggs are incorporated, stop beating to minimise getting bubbles in the batter (Note 7)., Remove air bubbles – Pour into the prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter then pop bubbles that rise to the surface with a small sharp knife. I do repeat 3 to 5 times. (Note 7), Bake 45 minutes or until the surface is a deep golden brown. It can take up to 65 minutes and that's fine! (Seriously, read Note 8) Keep a close eye on it for the last 15 minutes, you want it deeply golden but not burnt. The centre will still be wobbly and the cake will rise like a soufflé., Chill overnight – Cool in the cake pan for at least 2 hours on the counter (it will sink, that's normal). Then refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours, uncovered., Serving – Release the sides of the springform pan. Hold excess paper overhang to lift off base onto a cutting board or plate. Fold down sides – I love serving it on the paper, it's part of the visuals! Bring to room temp for 30 minutes if time permits, though also great served chilled. Cut like cake! Eat as is – doesn't need cream, berries etc."

As soon as the sugar is melted, remove the pan from the stove then carefully add the chicken (⚠️ it will sizzle so don't throw it in!) . Add ginger and shallots, toss briefly. The caramel may harden, that's ok, it will re-melt., Cook outside of chicken – Then put the pan back on the stove and stir just until the chicken changes from pink to white all over, but not browned, and definitely not cooked through., Simmer 10 min – Add water, stir, bring to a simmer. Simmer very rapidly, still on medium high (or even high!), for 10 to 12 minutes, until the liquid reduces right down to a glaze. It might take longer if your pan is smaller or your stove is weaker, that's ok. Stir every now and then while watery, then once it's reduced down to a glaze, toss regularly to get nice colour on the chicken. The further you take it, the better the colour!, Serve with jasmine rice or other plain rice garnished with extra slices of chilli and fresh coriander if desired.

(If doing a small amount of white chocolate, reduce to 20 second increments)., Piping bags – Transfer chocolate into a piping bag. Use scissors to snip a small opening at the tip. (Alternative: just drizzle with a spoon)., Drizzle & crumb – Push the popcorn together but in a single layer. Drizzle criss-cross (or any pattern!) all over the popcorn. Sprinkle with biscuits crumbs while the chocolate is wet so it sticks., Fridge – Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the chocolate is firm. Gently break popcorn into pieces. EAT!, Store in an airtight container in a cool place. Stays crisp for at least a week. Our test batches never lasted any longer!"

Pour wine around chicken., Roast 50 minutes – Roast 10 minutes to get the skin going. Then reduce the heat to 200°C /400°F (180°C fan) and roast for a further 40 minutes, basting every 10 minutes from the 20 minute mark onwards., Rest & serve – Remove from oven.

        "INSTRUCTIONS": [
            "French Dressing – Shake ingredients in a jar until well combined., Cook potatoes (CAREFUL! Note 5) – Put potatoes and 2 teaspoon salt in a large pot of cold water. Turn the stove on. Once the water is simmering, cook for 4 minutes or until the potatoes are JUST cooked (still bit firm in the middle) – they will keep cooking with residual heat. Drain immediately (gently!)., Douse hot potatoes! Carefully transfer potatoes into a large bowl and pour over French Dressing. Gently toss to coat then set aside for 2 hours so potatoes absorb the dressing and cool (less fragile)., Crispy bacon – Lay half the bacon in a cold non-stick pan. Turn onto medium high and cook until golden (the fat will melt as the pan warms up so it cooks in its own fat). Turn and cook the other side until golden. Drain paper towels, repeat with remaining bacon. Once cool and crisp, chop into small pieces., Creamy Dressing – Mix ingredients in a bowl until combined., Toss – Add creamy dressing, celery, cucumber, onion, and most of the bacon. Toss gently to combine., Serving – Serve garnished with remaining bacon. If time permits, I recommend setting aside for a few hours, or even better, overnight, to give the flavours a chance to meld. But still amazing served straight away! Always serve at room temperature, not fridge cold."

Flip then cook the other side for 1 1/2 minutes or until golden. Remove onto a plate., Cook remaining – If your non-stick coating is good, you won't need more butter though a very light brush of melted butter every 2nd or 3rd pancake won't hurt. Continue cooking, lowering the heat as you go as the pan gets hotter. You should get 9 to 10 in total. Keep cooked pancakes stacked so they keep each other warm (or use a low 50C/125F oven)., Serve ricotta pancakes with macerated strawberries (below), softened butter and copious amounts of maple syrup!",

Pour over the reserved 1/2 cup of fish poaching stock, and toss to mix through (it moistens the rice)., Season with salt if required – Check the rice for seasoning. If you used store-bought packet stock, you should find there's enough natural saltiness already. Otherwise season to taste and mix rice well., Peas & fish – Stir through the peas and most of the coriander (hold some back for garnish). Then gently fold through the fish, taking care to keep some pieces in large chunks., Serve – Spoon out rice onto one large platter or individual plates to serve.

        ],
        "INSTRUCTIONS": [
            "Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Lightly grease then line three baking trays with paper., Brown butter – Melt butter in a small silver pan or saucepan over medium heat (Note 2). Leave to simmer on medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring every now and then, until (when you push foam aside) you see little golden-brown bits. Immediately pour the butter and all the brown bits into a large mixing bowl (large enough to mix the cookie dough) and set aside to cool for 5 minutes., Chop choc – Cut the chocolate into 1cm /1/4\" pieces. Transfer the chunks into a bowl and leave the fine chocolate dust behind for another purpose (makes cookies speckled, Note 1)., Mix dry ingredients – Whisk flour, oats, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl., Back to the butter – Add sugar to the brown butter and whisk (it might not combine fully). Add egg and vanilla, whisk until smooth., Finish dough – Add dry ingredients into the egg-butter mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until the flour is almost mixed in. Add chocolate, and stir until mixed through and you can no longer see flour. Set aside for 5 minutes to let the mixture firm up a bit., Cookies – Scoop a heaped tablespoon of dough onto the tray, 5 cm / 2 \" apart. (I use a size 40 cookie scoop, makes 22 cookies) Flatten to 8 mm / 1/3\" thick, reshaping sides if needed if they split/go wonky., Bake – Bake 2 trays for 11 minutes, switching shelves and rotating the tray at the 7 minute mark, or until the surface is light golden. For 1 tray, bake 10 minutes, rotating the tray at the 6 minute mark., Cool on the tray for 10 minutes, then transfer onto a cooling rack to fully cool. (A sprinkle of salt flakes wouldn't go astray!)"
