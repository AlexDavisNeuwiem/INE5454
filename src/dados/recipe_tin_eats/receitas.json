Set aside., Sweet potato – Cut each sweet potato lengthways into 6 wedges (or 8, if they are thicker potatoes). Put on a paper lined tray, then toss with the maple syrup, olive oil, salt and pepper. Lay sweet potato wedges on their side., Chickpeas – Drain the chickpeas then spread on a tray (still wet)., Baking – Put both trays in the oven (sweet potato on the top shelf). Roast the potatoes for 30 minutes, turning them at the halfway mark. Take the chickpeas out after 10 minutes to flavour them., Crispy seasoned chickpeas – Remove the oven dried chickpeas from the oven after 10 minutes (Note 4). Push them to one side of the tray, drizzle/sprinkle and toss with the oil, spices, salt and pepper. Toss well using a rubber spatula, then return to the oven for a further 15 – 20 minutes until they're crispy (they will clatter! Note 4)., Sweet potato charring (optional) – After 30 minutes (or when the potatoes are soft), switch the oven grill/broiler to high. Tuck in or fold down excess paper around the tray edges (so it doesn't touch heat element and catch fire). Stand the wedges sharp edge facing up, then pop it under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes until a bit charred on the edges. ⚠️ SAFETY NOTE: Do not walk away, make sure the paper does not catch fire., Whipped tahini yogurt sauce – While the potatoes are roasting whisk ingredients in a heat-proof bowl just to combine. When ready to use, microwave for just 30 seconds on high, then whisk again for 10 seconds – it will resemble softly whipped cream. (Note 5), Optional tahini drizzle – Remove 1/4 cup of the tahini sauce and loosen with a little water to a drizzle-able consistency., Assemble – Spread the whipped tahini on a large plate. Pile the sweet potato on, mostly in a single layer. Drizzle with the tahini drizzle (if using), the spicy maple sauce, sprinkle with most of the pistachio and coriander. Sprinkle over chickpeas, then sprinkle with the remaining coriander and pistachios. EAT! (PS Great served warm or at room temperature)"

Cook for 2 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature is 98°C/208°F or the meat can be fairly easily teased apart using two fork (check in a discreet spot)., Rest – Remove lamb and potato to a tray and loosely cover with foil while you make the gravy.",
            "Drippings – The roasting pan will have meat juices and fat. Tilt the pan so you can scoop off and discard all but 3 tablespoons of fat (the clear liquid that rises to the surface). Make sure you keep the dark brown juices in the pan. If you're short of fat, add butter., Heat fat – Put the pan directly on the stove over medium heat. Once the fat is hot, sprinkle the flour over and stir for 1 minute., Thicken – While stirring, slowly pour in the stock. Add soy sauce, then keep stirring as it bubbles gently until it thickens into a maple syrup consistency., Taste and add more salt and pepper if desired (I don't need more). Pour into a jug (strain, if needed).",

            "Large pot – Bring a large pot with 15cm / 6 water to the boil. Lower eggs in gently using a spider or slotted spoon. Lower heat a tiny bit if needed to stop the eggs from jostling around so much they crack., Boil and swirl –  Boil eggs for 10 minutes. Swirl the water every minute for the first 6 minutes, using the handle of a wooden spoon. Give the water 4 or 5 fast stirs in one direction to make the water and eggs swirl in the water. The centrifugal force will make the yolks cook centred in the egg white (ie no thin broken egg white walls) (Note 4)., Peel – Fill a sink with cold tap water. Remove eggs from the boiling water using a slotted spoon or spider. Leave for 5 minutes until cool enough to handle. Tap the base then peel under water (it's easier).",
            "Remove yolks – Cut eggs in half and remove the yolks using a teaspoon., Filling – Place the yolks and all filling ingredients EXCEPT butter in a small food processor (Note 5). Blitz until yolks are broken up. Add butter and blitz, scraping down the sides as needed, until the butter is blended through. The filling should be creamy (smear with back of spoon to check)., Choose the best 18 to 20 egg white halves. (Note 6) Brush yolk crumbs off the cut surface., Pipe – Transfer filling into a piping bag fitted with a nozzle of your choice (I use a star). Fill so it's mounded – I do about the same amount as a whole yolk., Sprinkle with paprika and chives. Serve! (Best enjoyed at room temperature rather than fridge cold as the filling is creamier.)"

Set aside to cool for 15 minutes and let the pasta absorb the dressing flavour., Bruschetta – Put chopped tomato and all watery juices into a bowl. Pour over remaining Dressing, gently toss. Set aside for 10 minutes or until the pasta is cool to let the flavours meld., Finishing (the order matters!) – Pour the juices accumulated in the tomato bowl into the pasta then toss to disperse.

If using extra finishes, drizzle with a swish of balsamic glaze (not too much, it's strong!) and sprinkle with pine nuts. Eat!"

Add the vanilla, lemon and melted gelatine, then beat for 10 seconds on high to mix it through thoroughly. Don't beat excessively as we don't want too many air bubbles in the cheesecake (unsightly)., Fold – Add about 1/4 of the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Gently fold through using a rubber spatula or large spoon (don't mix aggressively, you'll knock all the air out of the cream!). Then fold in the rest of the cream., Refrigerate – Pour into the pan and smooth the surface. Refrigerate for 12 hours+ to set.",
            "Remove – Use the paper overhang to lift the cheesecake out of the pan and transfer it onto a serving platter. Then slide the paper out from underneath. Refrigerate until ready to decorate., Whip cream – Put the ingredients in a bowl and whip on high for 2 to 3 minutes until softly whipped. (Use an electric beater or stand mixer fitted with a whisk. Also, see Note 6 for stabilising to assemble ahead)., Decorate – Spread the cream in big swirls across the surface of the cake. Pile on the berries and cherries, tuck in the orange slices and rosemary. Dust with icing sugar then cut into slices and serve!"

Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls. Then flatten and press the base and walls using something with a flat base and vertical edges (I used a measuring cup). Aim for the wall to be ~9mm (0.35\") from the top of the rim (Note 7). Refrigerate crust until required.",

Cool for 5 minutes while you make the filling (make sure it's still liquid when you use it).",
            "Whip cream – Put the cream in a bowl and whip it with an electric beater on high for 2 minutes until firm peaks form (ie not softly whipped, we want good aeration!)., Whip cream cheese – Put the cream cheese and sugar in a separate large bowl. Using the same beater (no need to clean), beat on high for 1 minute just until it's soft and smooth. Add the vanilla, lemon and melted gelatine, then beat for 10 seconds on high to mix it through thoroughly. Don't beat excessively as we don't want too many air bubbles in the cheesecake (unsightly)., Fold – Add about 1/4 of the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Gently fold through using a rubber spatula or large spoon (don't mix aggressively, you'll knock all the air out of the cream!). Then fold in the rest of the cream., Refrigerate – Pour into the crust, smooth the surface. Refrigerate for 6 hours+ to set.",
            "Remove sides of the cake pan. Use then overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan base onto a serving platter. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper., Decorate the top with whipped cream and strawberries, if desired (or just dollop whipped cream on the plate). Cut into slices and serve!"

Mix and bring to a simmer., Add the pasta, stir, let it come back up to the simmer. Put the lid on and lower the heat slightly to medium so the liquid is simmering (not bubbling madly)., Cook for 15 minutes, stirring every few minutes so the base doesn't catch. The pasta should be a bit firmer than you want in the middle, and still a bit soupy which is good! Liquid gets absorbed in the next step., Melt cheese – Give it a stir, smooth the surface, sprinkle with cheese. Put the lid on then turn the stove off (leave the pot on the stove). Leave for 3 minutes so the residual heat melts the cheese and the pasta finishes cooking., Serve – Remove from the stove, sprinkle with green onion if desired, then serve immediately while saucy and the cheese is gooey!"
